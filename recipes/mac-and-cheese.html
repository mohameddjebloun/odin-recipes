    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese—also called mac and cheese in the 
        United States and macaroni cheese in the United 
        Kingdom[1]—is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a 
        cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also 
        incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs 
        or meat.[</p>
    <p>Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole 
        baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in 
        a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged 
        mix.[3] The cheese is often first incorporated into 
        a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is 
        then added to the pasta. In the United States, it 
        is considered a comfort food.</p>
